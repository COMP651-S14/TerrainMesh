6 a: Point location GS-style.
Suppose that you had a triangle that contained p and want a triangle
that contains q.  Or, more specifically, you have an edge of this
triangle that has p on or to the left and q to the right.
Implement the point location suggested by Guibas and Stolfi's paper. 
Demonstrate a triangulation that is not a Delaunay triangulation for
which this scheme can go into an infinite loop.
